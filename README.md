Solution for the next Challenge:

Your task is to implement the following algorithm for the given n:  
 * let x equal the product of digits in n 
 * n = 
 * x if n >= 10, goto 1
 * return n. 
 
Example  For n = "1234"
the output should be MultipleNumber(n) = 8.  1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 and 2 * 4 = 8
thus the answer is 8.
